    <h1>Whoa! Hold up üö®</h1>
    <p>
      You just tried to log in to what looked like Instagram... but it wasn‚Äôt real.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yup ‚Äî this was a <span class="highlight">mock phishing page</span>. No harm done, but it could‚Äôve been.
    </p>
    <p>
      Think about it ‚Äî if this were a real attack, your username and password would now be in someone else‚Äôs hands. Kinda scary, right?
    </p>
    <p>
      Phishing tricks people using fake pages that look almost exactly like real ones. They usually come through sketchy emails, DMs, or random links.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next time, double-check the URL, look for HTTPS, and don‚Äôt trust stuff that feels rushed or fishy üêü.
    </p>
    <p>
      Stay sharp. Stay safe. Your account deserves better than getting hijacked by a fake login screen.
